## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend developer focused on building efficient, flexible, and scalable GraphQL APIs using Node.js and MongoDB. This space showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my approach to backend architectureâ€”centered on performance, clean code, and powerful data handling.

GraphQL is my preferred API technology for its ability to deliver precisely the data clients need while reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. I design schemas that are thoughtful and extensible, making it easier for front-end teams to integrate while maintaining a clear and organized structure on the backend. I also implement resolvers, custom directives, and middleware for authentication, rate-limiting, and error handling to create robust APIs.

Node.js serves as the foundation for most of my services, allowing me to build lightweight, asynchronous, and scalable server applications. I utilize popular libraries like Apollo Server, Express, and Mongoose to handle everything from routing and data access to real-time subscriptions and performance optimizations.

MongoDB complements this stack by offering a flexible, document-oriented data model that aligns well with evolving application requirements. I focus on designing well-structured collections, optimizing queries, and implementing efficient indexing strategies to handle growing datasets.

This repository contains GraphQL API examples, backend service templates, and end-to-end features such as authentication, pagination, and nested querying. My goal is to create reusable components and scalable patterns that support both rapid development and long-term maintainability.

Feel free to browse the code, fork projects, or reach out if youâ€™re working on similar technologies. Iâ€™m always open to sharing ideas, learning from others, and contributing to the community around modern API design and backend development.
